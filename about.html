    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Hello! My name is Natasha and I would consider myself a creative technologist.
        I have tinkered with machine learning and data engineering throughout my career. 
        At the same time, I like to use code to design user-friendly webpages.

    </p>
    <p>
        I am constantly fascinated by the power of code and various algorithms to shape our lives. 
        This fascination has driven me to explore more of the possibilities in my field where I bring
        both my technical and design experience into new projects and innovations.
    </p>

        Outside of work I like to paint and go on many scenic hikes. Feel free to view some pictures I have taken below
